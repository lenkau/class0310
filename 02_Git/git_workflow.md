## Steps for Git

1. Tell Git that a particular folder is to be tracked **git init**
2. Make changes
    1. add those changes in a temporary area **git add**
    2. add more changes **git add**
2. I'm happy with this version. Take a snapshot
    1. git commit -m "main change made"

**git diff** tells you what changed in which files between commits
**git show** even better

**q** to get out of the log view

In VS Code there is a source control function, maybe easier to handle
There easy to get overview over what changed and where
